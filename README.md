## Introduction
This is a collaborative project with other students at the University of Melbourne using the [Hollywood Stock Exchange](https://www.hsx.com/) database. I was responsible for writing a complex SQL query to calculate the profit and loss of all closed positions for all traders. The difficult part of writing the query was figuring out the logic of determining whether a trade position was closed or not, based on the trade type (Long or Short) and the remaining quantity of stock held in a position. This task demonstrates the ability to use CASE statements, JOIN clauses, OVER PARTITION BY clauses, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs) in SQL. 

## Skill Summary
* Perform row by row calculation with SQL
* Using CASE statements
* Using multiple JOIN clauses
* Using OVER PARTITION BY clauses
* Using subqueries in FROM statements
* Using multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
